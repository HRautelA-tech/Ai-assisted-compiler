## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 *ML-Based Optimization Decisions*  
  Uses trained models to decide when and how to apply certain optimizations.

- 📈 *Performance-Aware Transformations*  
  Focuses on improving runtime efficiency and/or memory usage.

- 🔁 *Feedback Loop Integration*  
  Supports training with runtime profiling data for continuous learning.

- 🛠 *Modular Compiler Architecture*  
  Built to integrate with existing compiler pipelines (e.g., LLVM, custom IR).

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- 🔧 Core: Python / C++ / [Your language]
- 🧮 ML Framework: PyTorch / TensorFlow / scikit-learn
- 📦 Compiler Backend: LLVM / Custom Intermediate Representation
- 📊 Profiling Tools: perf / Valgrind / Custom Logger

## 🧪 How It Works

1. *Parsing & IR Generation*: Source code is parsed and transformed into an Intermediate Representation (IR).
2. *Feature Extraction*: Extracts static or dynamic features from the IR.
3. *ML Model Inference*: Uses a trained model to recommend optimization passes.
4. *Code Transformation*: Applies optimizations accordingly.
5. *Code Generation*: Emits optimized target code (e.g., x86, ARM).
